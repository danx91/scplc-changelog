Hello there! Another year passed since the last update, but update finally is here featuring huge changes like complete rewrite and redesign of all SCPs and redesign of whole GUI of the gamemode. This time exactly 186 have changed ^^ I will try my best to describe all changes here, but I'm 100% sure I will miss many things so feel free to explore changes on your own with your friends.

## Additions
* Added SCP-009
* Added SCP-689
* Added backpacks
* Added prestige system and 3 special prestige classes:
    * Class-D Tailor - has ability to change clothes
    * Class-D Escapee - runaway Class-D disguised as scientist with scientist ID
    * Guard Engineer - Has door blocker that can temporarily block 
* Added fuse boxes to enable EZ gas ventilation
* Added fuse boxes to enable SCP-106 room ventilation
* Added fuse boxes to enable SCP-106 recontain procedure
* Added intercom
* Added low priority support queue
* Added new command `!queue` to check position in support queue
* Added announcement sounds queue - now multiple announcements won't overlap
* Added GUI Skins - now you can select between new (default) GUI or old (legacy) one
* Added new HUD (you can change it to old one if you want)
* Added new scoreboard (you can change it to old one if you want)
* Added new EQ (old one is gone - you **can't** change it to old one)
* Added admin mode (accessed by `!adminmode`) - powerful tool for server administrators
* Added door breaching
* Added snake minigame
* Added light and heavy CI spies
* Added increasing chance of becoming an SCP if you are not spawning as SCP
* Added SCP avoid list (by default SCP-173 and SCP-096 will never spawn in the same round)
* And a lot of smaller additions that I forgot to mention...

## General Changes
* Destroying CCTV as ally of Foundation will grant you negative points
* ALPHA and OMEGA warheads can no longer be detonated if any GOC is alive
* All items upgraded in SCP-914 have 10s of pickup priority
* Now you can't use multiple items that interact with the same part of your game (e.g. you can't use CCTV and NVG together as they both modify your vision)
* Tweaked properties and stats of bunch of items
* Now Class-D and Scientists are neutral towards each other
* Neutral teams no longer block escape or hold round
* And a lot of smaller changes that I forgot to mention...

## SCP Changes
Describing all mechanics of all SCPs here would take about 5 whole A4 pages so I won't do that. All SCPs got redesign of abilities and all of them were rewritten from scratch (except SCP-058 as it's the newest SCP). All skills of SCPs are described in class viewer (F1 button). Have fun discovering all the mechanics on your own.

## Bug fixes
* Fixed issue that made every player have the same SCP-1025 disease
* Fixed few issues with CW 2.0 weapons
* A lot of fixed LUA errors
* A lot of fixed small issues
* And probably more...

## For developers
There was a lot of code refactoring and some function calls have changed. Here is the list of things that changed (it might be incomplete):
* Changed `PLAYER:DisableControls` and other related functions
* Changed `PLAYER:StartHold` and other related functions
* Whole MySQL library has changed
* `SCPHUDObject` got complete rewrite and now has to be defined in a new way (old way won't work)
* `weapon_scp_base` changed a lot - your custom SCPs might need some adjustments
* Changed `OpenWheelMenu` and how it works
* Added `controller` - more generic and more customizable version of `drive` that works better (for me at least)
* Now all `GetSCPData` calls are **asynchronous** and return a promise! - you either have to cache it on your own or use `RegisterPlayerStatus` as it internally caches DB values
* Changed `ENTITY:TestVisibility` call and added bunch of changes for better detection
* Added `RoundHooks` - check `core/hooks.lua`
* Added A* algorithm - see `core/sv_astar.lua`
* Changed how SCP upgrades pare descriptions
* Complete rewrite of `SetupPlayers` and `SpawnSupport` functions

I think that's all but I'm not 100% sure. Also, there are few new tools available in `_developer.lua`
