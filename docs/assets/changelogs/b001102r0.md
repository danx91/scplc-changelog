## For developers
* Replaced all surface.DrawRing and surface.DrawFilledCircle with SLCDrawRing and SLCDrawCircle (surface versions are backward compatible so you don't have to change them now)
* Support for multiple files per single language has been added and all languages have been split into multiple files.
* PlayerInfo has been moved from data directory to database - to migrate existing data use `lua_run slc_convert_playerinfo_to_db()`
* `table.Random` was replaced to use `SLCRandom` - no actions needed
* Added spawn function for syringes for ItemSpawnRule
* SLCVar limit has been updated to 64 vars per type (old limit was 16)
* PlayerData has been removed and was replaced by `BindPlayerProperty()`
* Most of the player functions have been replaced:
	* `PLAYER:SCPLevel()` -> `PLAYER:PlayerLevel()`
	* `PLAYER:SetSCPLevel()` -> `PLAYER:SetPlayerLevel()`
	* `PLAYER:SCPExp()` -> `PLAYER:PlayerXP()`
	* `PLAYER:Set_SCPExp()` -> `PLAYER:SetPlayerXP()`
	* `PLAYER:SCPClassPoints()` -> `PLAYER:ClassPoints()`
	* etc... to see all changes take a look at the end of `sh_player.lua`
