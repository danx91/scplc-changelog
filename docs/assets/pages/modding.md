# Modding Basics
## Important notes
Before even starting your journey into such an exciting thing like editing this gamemode, you have to know some basics:
1. You have to know how to use [search engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine) of your choice (Google, DuckDuckGo, Yandex, Bing, Yahoo!, etc.) - you will need to use it **a lot**
2. You have to know something about programming and also you have to know Lua and GLua syntax and way how it works. If you don't, first learn GLua. These link may be helpful:
	* [Lua 5.1 Manual](http://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/)
	* [Lua Users](http://lua-users.org/)
	* [Facepunch Tutorial](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Beginner_Tutorial_Intro)
	* [CODE BLUE Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1mQ3mpdiJU&list=PLyQg3m0a5UivaAXEfVDngKYp9jyNSTIo_)
4. I'm not your personal wikipedia - I can provide limited help, guide you in right direction or provide useful resources, but **I won't** write code for you or answer questions that show your lack of knowledge
3. You have to *learn the gamemode*. That means you have to go through ALL files and learn what's inside each of them so you have basic knowledge what is where. At the time of writing this, gamemode has 61.5 thousands lines of code distributed among 176 files (image below). That's a lot, but you have to get over it.
