## SCP 049 Zombie Creation Rework
This system was introduced to force SCP-049 to chose different SCP types so special types of zombies got buffed, but limits were also introduced:
* SCP-049 have now 2 limits - available zombie types and maximum zombies of every type
* SCP-049 starts with 1/1 of every special zombie type
* Each creation of special zombie type reduces available and maximum number of this type is reduced by 1, **but** receives 1 maximum charge of other special types
* By creating normal zombie, SCP-049 refills all available special types by 1 (it can't go over maximum)
* Examples:
	* SCP-049 has 1/1 of every special zombie
	* SCP-049 creates spitting one -> now he has: 0/0 spitting and 1/2 assassins and exploding
	* SCP-049 creates normal zombie -> now he has: 0/0 spitting, 2/2 assassins and exploding
	* SCP-049 creates exploding zombie -> now he has: 0/1 spitting, 2/3 assassins and 1/1 exploding
	* and so on...
